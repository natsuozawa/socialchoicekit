Welcome to socialchoicekit's documentation!
============================================

**socialchoicekit** aims to be a comprehensive implementation of important algorithms in computational social choice theory, with a focus on algorithms that deal with distortion. It is currently in development by Natsu Ozawa under the supervision of Dr. Aris Filos-Ratsikas at the University of Edinburgh.

To get a grasp of the computational social choice theory concepts necessary to work with this library, take a look at the :ref:`concepts` page.

We also have a :ref:`getting_started` guide to help you get started coding.
